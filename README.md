=========

Make the best of the odds and ends in your fridge.

FridgeFun helps you come up with recipes to deal with the random items in your fridge. A user can enter what they have, and the application will calculate what recipe from the database requires the least amount of additional ingredients. 

FridgeFun was created by Lily Xie and Jenny Wang for CS230 in Spring 2013.
